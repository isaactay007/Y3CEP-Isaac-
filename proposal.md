# General description of project
> Creating a personal score tracker to collect scores from tests for all subjects
> 
#Goals of project
> Calculate future socres needed for EOY tests to attain a certain grade and prioritise subjetcs based on the amount of effort needed to put in
> 
# Listing of features
> Collect past test scores 
> Calculate current percentages for all subjects
> Order subjects from most amount of marks needed in EOY test to attain 4.0 grade to least amount of marks needed

# External Scanning
> There are some personal study apps online which gives a set time to be used for studying. My project will not be focused on the amount of time used for studying, but rather focus on the subjects itself that need to be improved

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> Closer to the EOY dates, students may spend more time studying topics they like/ are good at and neglect the subjects they are weaker at, especially for replaceable subjects 
> e.g. if a student takes triple science, he may only focus on the subjects he scores the most at. However, this is not a good way to improve oneself.

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> How to calculate percentage given subject scores
> how to list an ordered rank of subjects and make them easily accessible to the user
